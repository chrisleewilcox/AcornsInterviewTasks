# Notes:

I was having issues with Capybara's 'wait_until' function so I resorted to using sleeps.  Will get back to getting
'wait_until' working if time permits.

As of 7/25/2018 at 2:00pm I was getting 404 error with the webservice doc pages for Property Details and Valuation API's.
- https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/HomeValuationAPIOverview.htm
- https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/PropertyDetailsAPIOverview.htm

Was not able to get the information needed for those webservices.  Will utilize another Zillow search
to automate.
