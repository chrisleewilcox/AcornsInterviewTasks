Notes:
I was getting 404 error with the webservice doc pages for Property Details API, Valuation API.
- https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/HomeValuationAPIOverview.htm
- https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/PropertyDetailsAPIOverview.htm
Was not able to get the information needed for those webservices.  Will utilize another Zillow search
to automate.
